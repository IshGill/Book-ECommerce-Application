## GitHub Issue Solved:

closes # 5<!--Reference the number of the solved issue-->

## Current behaviour

Menu nav bar, currently redirects to all required pages except for register and login page which still need to be defined. 

## Changed behaviour

User will be able to use nav bar to traverse to different webpages on the website, each button has a hovering effect.

## Notes

Need to check how the nav bar will react when a user is logged in as there is a Hello, {{User}} implementation for the nav bar.
